# Tutorial on Loading Models with ESP-DL

In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of loading an ESP-DL model.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the ESP-IDF development environment installed and your development board properly configured. Additionally, you need to have a pre-trained model file that has been quantized using `esp-ppq` and exported in the `espdl` model format.

## Method 1: Loading the Model from `rodata`

### 1. **Add the Model File in `CMakeLists.txt`**:
   Refer to the documentation [ESP-IDF Build System](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/zh_CN/stable/esp32/api-guides/build-system.html#cmake-embed-data) to add the `espdl` model file to the `.rodata` section of the chip flash.

   ```cmake
   set(embed_files your_model_path/model_name.espdl)
   idf_component_register(...
                          EMBED_FILES ${embed_files})
   ```

### 2. **Load the Model in Your Program**:
   Use the following method to load the model:

   ```cpp
   // "_binary_model_name_espdl_start" is composed of three parts: the prefix "binary", the filename "model_name_espdl", and the suffix "_start".
   extern const uint8_t espdl_model[] asm("_binary_model_name_espdl_start");

   Model *model = new Model((const char *)espdl_model, fbs::MODEL_LOCATION_IN_FLASH_RODATA);
   ```

## Method 2: Loading the Model from `partition`

### 1. **Add Model Information in `partition.csv`**:
   Add the model's `offset`, `size`, and other information in the `partition.csv` file.

   ```csv
   # Name,   Type, SubType, Offset,  Size, Flags
   factory,  app,  factory,  0x010000,  4000K,
   model,   data,  spiffs,        ,  4000K,
   ```

### 2. **Add Automatic Loading Program in `CMakeLists.txt`**:
   Skip this step if you choose to manually flash.

   ```cmake
   set(image_file your_model_path)
   partition_table_get_partition_info(size "--partition-name model" "size")
   if("${size}")
       esptool_py_flash_to_partition(flash "model" "${image_file}")
   else()
   ```

### 3. **Load the Model in Your Program**:
   There are two methods to load the model.

   - Load the model using the constructor:

     ```cpp
     // method1:
     Model *model = new Model("model", fbs::MODEL_LOCATION_IN_FLASH_PARTITION);
     ```

   - First load the `fbs_model`, then create the model using the `fbs_model` pointer:

     ```cpp
     // method2:
     fbs::FbsLoader *fbs_loader = new fbs::FbsLoader("model", fbs::MODEL_LOCATION_IN_FLASH_PARTITION);
     fbs::FbsModel *fbs_model = fbs_loader->load();
     Model *model2 = new Model(fbs_model);
     ```

By following the steps above, you can successfully load a pre-trained model using the ESP-DL library. We hope this tutorial is helpful to you!
